= Clean- Onion- Hexagonal Architecture

NOTE: See: https://dev.to/danielrusnok/onion-architecture-or-how-to-not-make-spaghetti-244b[https://dev.to/danielrusnok/onion-architecture-or-how-to-not-make-spaghetti-244b,role=external,window=_blank] Core of application is defined by tasks or Bussiness rules, which application should fulfil.

image:OnionArchitecture.png[OnionArchitecture]

== Application layer
The core called Application contains every work done with entities or value objects. In the introduction, I talked about tasks or business rules. Example of business rule could be a task "Save customer." But wait, such a rule will have to work with the database. And at the introduction, we made it clear that the database should not be a part of the application's core. So where is the database?


=== Domain
=== Application

== Presentation layer
Client API can be found in the _Presentation_ _layer_

== Persistence layer
Database can be found in the _Persistence_ _layer_ (MongoDB, In-Memory DB etc.)

== Infrastructure layer
Communication with external technologies/Systems is placed in the _Infrastructure_ _layer_
